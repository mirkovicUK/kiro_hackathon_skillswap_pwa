# Update DEVLOG

Update the DEVLOG.md file with the latest development progress.

## Instructions

1. Read the current DEVLOG.md file
2. Ask the user what they accomplished in this session:
   - What task(s) were completed?
   - How much time was spent?
   - Any technical decisions made?
   - Any challenges encountered and how they were solved?
   - Which Kiro prompts/features were used?

3. Add a new entry to DEVLOG.md following the existing format:
   - Use the current date
   - Include time spent
   - Document decisions with rationale
   - Note any challenges and solutions
   - Track Kiro CLI usage

4. Update the running totals in the Time Breakdown section if present

## Format Example

```markdown
### Day X (Jan XX) - [Task Name] [Xh]
- **Completed**: [What was done]
- **Decisions**: [Technical choices made and why]
- **Challenges**: [Problems faced and solutions]
- **Kiro Usage**: [Prompts and features used]
```

Always maintain the professional tone and structure of the existing DEVLOG.
